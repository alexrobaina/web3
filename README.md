# Tempate - react - web3

The project is made with typescript and react js. Add different libraries and various components that I usually use in my projects and I am modifying as needed.

##

In the structure of the project you can find the store with redux, redux-toolkit and sagas as an example so that you can see my knowledge in these technologies together with test examples.
Most of the components of the application are tested except for the views.

##

To do the tests with MetaMask it is necessary to have the "MetaMask" extension installed in your browser and have an account. I associated the wallet with accounts provided by the ganache software. With the sado of these accounts I was able to make transactions

Deploy example:
https://challenge-web3.vercel.app/

## Install some libraries that I think help maintain good practices

eslint
Prettier
Husky

### Instructions for running the project

I recommend installing node v14.16.0 version to install the packages

- Install yarn
- Clone repository

Run in the terminal

```
$ cd challenge-web3
```

```
$ yarn
```

```
$ yarn start

🍺  happy code!
